I am currently a sophmore majoring in ECE: Computer Engineering at University of California, San Diego.

If I had to describe myself with one word, it would be autodidactic â€“ "relating to or being a person who learns or has learned a subject without the benefit of a teacher or formal education." One of my passions is teaching myself new skills that can be applied to the real world.

I aspire to become a computer hardware engineer and involve myself in entrepreneurship. My main interests include hardware design like PCB's, 3D modeling and printing, animation, digital art, and custom mechanical keyboards.

# Selected Experience

## I currently lack experience, however, I'm eager to learn and dedicated to becoming a valueable team member.
