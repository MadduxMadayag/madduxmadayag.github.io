My brother is graduating this year and with his birthday coming up and his passion for competitive Super Smash Bros, I decided to create a custom GameCube controller as a gift. Modding a GameCube controller can't be that difficult... right?

## Design and Mods

![](/images/m4/design.jpg)

The design of the controller is based influenced by the anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, my brother's favorite anime. On the left is the first draft my brother quickly created and on the right is the final design we settled on. I utilized [Fires' shell design template](https://firescc.com/gcc-tech-guides#/shell-design-template), this can be useful if you plan to send it to someone to paint/customize the controller for you which I did. 



## Purchasing The Parts

### Paracord



### Controller Case

I didn't have the tools and environment to spray paint the GameCube controller myself so I searched the internet for someone reputable. The CustomGCC discord provided a [website](https://customg.cc/vendors) for vendors, but for some reason the spreadsheet would never load for me. I continued to research but after a few days of no luck, I decided to reach out to [NachoCustomz](https://twitter.com/NachoCustomz) who specializes in customizing mouses. I found his paint jobs and water decals to be very clean. After paying for the commission and shipping a controller, I stumbled upon [ModderMap](https://www.nojonsmods.com/moddermap), a resource for GameCube controller modders and technicians by location. Defintely worth checking out.
