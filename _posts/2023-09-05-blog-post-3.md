When I first became involved with custom mechanical keyboards a few years ago, I believed I would love the typing sounds of "thock," "clack," and "pop." However, I found that I preferred silent switches. One of the greatest benefits is that I could work quietly late at night without disturbing others with my fast typing. I realized I had never actively paid attention to the sound of my keyboard, and there was something about their quietness and feel that was very appealing to me. One day, I stumbled upon [:3ildcat's video](https://youtu.be/3jMrlHMZ00A?si=BzuQQKQJveCahVKi&t=260) about replacing the switches in his mouse with silent ones. I instantly thought, "I need to make my mouse silent too."
